## 1. Project Description
This is a command line application that generates a simple logo based on user input. The user is prompted for text, text color, shape, and shape color. The user can enter up to three characters. The user can choose one of three shapes from a list. The user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number). The user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
